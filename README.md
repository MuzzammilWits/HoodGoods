* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) – For cloning the repository
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – JavaScript runtime (run `node -v` to verify)
* [Bruno (Optional but Recommended)](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads) – for API testing

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

You should first open a git bash terminal, then cd into where you would like the repo to live, once you found the right place for it run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuzzammilWits/HoodGoods.git
cd HoodGoods
ls
```

You should see: `backend`, `frontend`, and `brunoAPI`

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
npm install
nest start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 🚀 Daily Development Workflow

In future sessions, just run these commands in two separate terminals:
This allows the backend and frontend to be running at the same time so you can locally test and develop the website.

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
nest start
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

---

### 🧪 Bruno API Testing (Optional)

1. Install Bruno: [https://www.usebruno.com/downloads](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads)
2. Start your backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   nest start
   ```

   (Leave this running)
3. Open Bruno, click **Open Collection** (and go to your HoodGoods folder/repo and then click on the brunoAPI folder and select the BrunoAPI inside of that and open it, the path will be something like this below.):

   ```
   brunoAPI/BrunoAPI/HoodGoods API.bru
   ```
4. Click `GET test1` in the sidebar.
